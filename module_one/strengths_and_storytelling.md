#### Individual Reflection

* Look at your initial StrengthsFinder reflection that you completed in week 1 -- how have your perceptions of the top 5 themes stayed the same? How have they changed?

- My feelings on the 5 themes have stayed generally the same.  Overall I think there is a lot of room to grow from in terms of my strengths.  I found that during my pairing session with Becki my Strategic strengths shined in contrast to her ability to focus on the details.  I have found that my approach to development involves a lot of thinking about things many steps removed from the immediate problem.  This has resulted in me sometimes having a good view of the forest, but missing sight of the individual trees.


* How are you different today than when you first started at Turing? How are you stronger now than on day 1? How have you struggled?

- I struggled initially to organize things and keep on track in terms of organizing my workflow.  I was able to overcome this through many means and feel I am very well organized now.  I also struggled to learn some of the algorithmic concepts in MOD 1 such as a linked list, a binary search tree, and how a trie data structure works.  I feel like I have a better understanding of them as well as how recursion works and how to think about it.

* Considering how you describe these themes, how do you want others to see you as you continue to progress through Turing?
I want to be viewed as a friend and respected colleague to my peers.  I want to continue the relation of mutual assistance as I grow professionally.

* Even though your Turing story isn't finished yet, what do you envision for your development in future mods? How will this story end?

- I think I will get a lot better at creating and following a plan before I start developing.  It will always be an iterative process, but I would like to become better at creating a well thought-out plan and acting upon it.

* Finally, write a draft of your story here. This is a short paragraph, 4-6 sentences, describing who you are, why you came to Turing, and what you hope to accomplish while you're here.

- I started my career as an intelligence analyst in the navy, where I was able to analyze naval intelligence and cyber intelligence threats.  From there I gained practical experience related to general IT work at a software company in Denver.  I started as a Tech Support representation and worked my way up to a Systems Engineer who supported high priority, enterprise customers and assisting with on-site implementations of our software.  As I grew professionally, I realized that I would like to focus more on software development, so I enrolled in the Turing school of software and design in their back end program.
